# Go REST Service

## Overview

This repository serves as a dedicated learning environment for exploring and mastering RESTful API development using the Go programming language (Golang). The project is structured to demonstrate best practices, architectural patterns, and the integration of essential libraries and tools within the Go ecosystem.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this codebase is educational. It is designed to document the learning journey, experiment with different implementation strategies, and build a solid foundation in backend engineering with Go. Key areas of focus include:

*   **RESTful API Design**: Implementing standard HTTP methods and status codes.
*   **Clean Architecture**: Structuring the application for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Database Integration**: Managing data persistence and interacting with databases.
*   **Configuration Management**: Handling environment variables and application settings.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project is a work in progress and intended for study and experimentation. While it aims to follow professional standards, certain implementations may be simplified for learning purposes.
